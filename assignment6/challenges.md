# Challenges Using Accessibility Features

## High Contrast Mode
- Hurt my eyes because of intense contrast.
- Everything looks too sharp, not smooth.
- Any images (Desktop background, website images) were blown out and hard to distinguish.

## Magnification
- It was difficult to navigate around a page or find an item on the page since I could not see everything.
- I had to scroll to read any text.
- Horizontal scrolling was difficult since I could not use trackpad to scroll since horizontal swipes on trackpad were mapped to next and previous page in browser. I had to use cursor position to move left and right which took more time than needed.
- Vertical scrolling was fine.
