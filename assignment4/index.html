    <h2>What is JUCE and ValueTree?</h2>

    <p><a href="https://juce.com">JUCE</a> is a cross platform C++ framework
    with a set of classes useful for GUI and audio software development. It is
    open-source and free to use, but requires a license for commercial use.</p>

    <p><code>ValueTree</code> is one of JUCE's awesome classes. It is a tree data
    structure that holds data in a hierarchal structure, much like XML. Each
    piece of data in the tree can have listeners which get updated when that data
    is changed. Any changes to the data can be easily undone and redone, providing
    automatic undo/redo functionality. Finally, the <code>ValueTree</code> can
    be easily serialized to XML and reloaded from XML.</p>

    <p>The <code>ValueTree</code> data structure is advantageous to use to handle
    the data model of an application. Often in large applications, there may be
    many different settings a user can change. These settings often need to be
    able to be saved and loaded and undone and redone easily. Such data in an
    application is often thought of in a hierarchal structure. For example, for
    a photo editing application might contain many layers of images, each image
    might contain associated color settings as well as a list of different image
    effects, each effect might contain further individual settings, etc. A data
    model such as this can easily be represented as a <code>ValueTree</code>. If
    used in this way, a <code>ValueTree</code> can handle all the user settings,
    updates to those settings, save/load, and undo/redo for the entire application.
    If compared with an Model-View-Controller (MVC) design paradigm,
    <code>ValueTree</code> handles both the Model and the controller. A view
    could be made which holds reference to parts of the <code>ValueTree</code>
    that it needs to know about.
    </p>

    <h2>Development Strategy</h2>
      <h3>Data Model Definition and Hierarchy Design</h3>
      <p>The first step to using <code>ValueTree</code> to manage an
      application's data is to define the data hierarchy. You should first write
      this out on paper and make a few different drafts, but you can still change
      this design later. Next, create a file called <code>DataIdentifiers.h</code>
      which will contain all identifiers of different parts of the data Hierarchy.
      Try to organize this file in the same hierarchal fashion as you planned
      so that you can refer to this file later when determining how the data
      should be laid out.
      </p>

      <h3>Concrete ValueTree Classes</h3>
      <p>After defining the data model, you can begin creating classes to hold
      certain parts of the <code>ValueTree</code> model. These classes are referred
      to as "Concrete ValueTree Classes". You could use a <code>ValueTree</code>
      all by itself to interact with the data, but a "Concrete ValueTree Class"
      provides this access in a way that looks like normal objects and ensures
      things like type safety, level of access, etc.</p>

      <h3>Component View Classes</h3>
      <p>Finally, after creating the main data handling and access parts of our
      application with Concrete ValueTree Classes, we can now create UI
      elements with which a user can interact which display and modify Concrete
      ValueTree objects. This design has decoupled the data and view portions of
      our application, so we could have any number of views associated with a
      given Concrete ValueTree class.</p>
