# Challenges Using Accessibility Features

## High Contrast Mode
- Hurt my eyes because of intense contrast.
- Everything looks too sharp, not smooth.
- Any images (Desktop background, website images) were blown out and hard to distinguish.

## Magnification
- Was difficult to navigate.
- Trackpad scrolling left right in this mode did not work since it was mapped out to browser left/right
- To move horizontally, I had to move the cursor left and right awkwardly.
- Reading text was difficult because I could not read fast and could only focus on the large words in front of me.
- Seeing images was difficult because you could only see a zoomed in portion of an image and no the entire thing.
